# Hello you

I'm Alex and I love learning. This means that I have a diverse background (I have a woodworking certification; I can pick locks; I've done my share of teaching math) that helps in some surprising ways. It also means that when something new is needed, I'm eager to step up. I work well alone, though I prefer to work in a team. I can do frontend or backend, but I am best when I can do both.

My early times coding were through a startup incubator called Opus Logica. I worked in a disorganized fashion, in whatever language, on a team of one. Sometimes I would get to architect a project myself, and sometimes a client had a specific vision or prototype that dictated things. While at Opus Logica, I coded with jQuery, Backbone, Angular, Node, Rails, Grails, Cordova, MySQL, Postgres, RabbitMQ. Sometimes a client didn't really know what they wanted, and we had to try a few things in order to find out. I learned how to move quickly and not get too invested in one particular attack. I really enjoyed getting the excuse to learn new domains. I also became very comfortable not knowing everything before diving into a problem.

Before all that, I spent a few years as an acrobat in a circus. This, of course, didn't give me software experience. I did, however, mentor a bunch of acrobats. We traveled and performed in weird places. I was in charge of rigging aerial sets and blocking out scenes. Something I learned from working there was how to use different perspectives. It's really hard to figure out the best way for someone else to solve a problem because you will rely on your skillset, not theirs. I found that you need to give people room to improvise before you help them revise.

Recently, I've headed up the web team at a cryptocurrency wallet company. My team consists of three to six engineers (we've fluctuated a bit). We run some Go microservices and various Nuxt/Node apps. My time is divided between mentoring, fixing infrastructure, planning projects, and coding. I pretty much review every line that gets onto production, but I give the others a lot of stylistic flexibility. I make sure things are linted, functional, and semantically obvious; beyond that, I encourage people to foster their opinions.

I'm excited to work at a company that has a good long-term vision. I can work well remotely, or in a flexible office arrangement. I'm looking for a job as a technical team lead in a full-stack, frontend, or backend group. I don't super mind what the project is, as long as there are some interesting problems to solve!

Now, enough about me: I'm excited to hear more about your company!

Cheers,
Alex
